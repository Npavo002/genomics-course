##Challenge3
```{r}
#How many animals were caught in each plot_type surveyed?
surveys %>%
    count(plot_type)
#Use group_by() and summarize() to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length for each species (using species_id). Also add the number of observations (hint: see ?n).
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
    group_by(species_id) %>%
    summarize(
        mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length),
        min_hindfoot_length = min(hindfoot_length),
        max_hindfoot_length = max(hindfoot_length),
        n = n()
    )
#What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns year, genus, species_id, and weight.
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    filter(weight == max(weight)) %>%
    select(year, genus, species, weight) %>%

str(surveys_gather)
surveys_spread %>%
  gather(key = "genus", value = "mean_weight", Baiomys:Spermophilus) %>%
  head()
```

##Challenge4
```{r}
#Spread the surveys data frame with year as columns, plot_id as rows, and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarize before reshaping, and use the function n_distinct() to get the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data. It’s a powerful function! See ?n_distinct for more.
surveys_spread_genera <- surveys %>%
  group_by(plot_id, year) %>%
  summarize(n_genera = n_distinct(genus)) %>%
  spread(year, n_genera)
head(surveys_spread_genera)
#Now take that data frame and gather() it again, so each row is a unique plot_id by year combination.
surveys_spread_genera %>%
  gather("year", "n_genera", -plot_id)
#The surveys data set has two measurement columns: hindfoot_length and weight. This makes it difficult to do things like look at the relationship between mean values of each measurement per year in different plot types. Let’s walk through a common solution for this type of problem. First, use gather() to create a dataset where we have a key column called measurement and a value column that takes on the value of either hindfoot_length or weight. Hint: You’ll need to specify which columns are being gathered.
surveys_long <- surveys %>%
  gather("measurement", "value", hindfoot_length, weight)
#With this new data set, calculate the average of each measurement in each year for each different plot_type. Then spread() them into a data set with a column for hindfoot_length and weight. Hint: You only need to specify the key and value columns for spread().
surveys_long %>%
  group_by(year, measurement, plot_type) %>%
  summarize(mean_value = mean(value, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  spread(measurement, mean_value)

surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight),           # remove missing weight
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),  # remove missing hindfoot_length
         !is.na(sex))                # remove missing sex

## Extract the most common species_id
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
    count(species_id) %>% 
    filter(n >= 50)

## Only keep the most common species
surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>%
  filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)

dim(surveys_complete)

write_csv(surveys_complete, file = "Data/surveys_complete.csv")
